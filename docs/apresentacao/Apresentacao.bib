	abstract = {Background
The application of Big Data analytics in healthcare has immense potential for improving the quality of care, reducing waste and error, and reducing the cost of care.
Purpose
This systematic review of literature aims to determine the scope of Big Data analytics in healthcare including its applications and challenges in its adoption in healthcare. It also intends to identify the strategies to overcome the challenges.
Data sources
A systematic search of the articles was carried out on five major scientific databases: ScienceDirect, PubMed, Emerald, IEEE Xplore and Taylor \& Francis. The articles on Big Data analytics in healthcare published in English language literature from January 2013 to January 2018 were considered.
Study selection
Descriptive articles and usability studies of Big Data analytics in healthcare and medicine were selected.
Data extraction
Two reviewers independently extracted information on definitions of Big Data analytics; sources and applications of Big Data analytics in healthcare; challenges and strategies to overcome the challenges in healthcare.
Results
A total of 58 articles were selected as per the inclusion criteria and analyzed. The analyses of these articles found that: (1) researchers lack consensus about the operational definition of Big Data in healthcare; (2) Big Data in healthcare comes from the internal sources within the hospitals or clinics as well external sources including government, laboratories, pharma companies, data aggregators, medical journals etc.; (3) natural language processing (NLP) is most widely used Big Data analytical technique for healthcare and most of the processing tools used for analytics are based on Hadoop; (4) Big Data analytics finds its application for clinical decision support; optimization of clinical operations and reduction of cost of care (5) major challenge in adoption of Big Data analytics is non-availability of evidence of its practical benefits in healthcare.
Conclusion
This review study unveils that there is a paucity of information on evidence of real-world use of Big Data analytics in healthcare. This is because, the usability studies have considered only qualitative approach which describes potential benefits but does not take into account the quantitative study. Also, majority of the studies were from developed countries which brings out the need for promotion of research on Healthcare Big Data analytics in developing countries.},

	abstract = {The First Complete Guide to DevOps for Software Architects    DevOps promises to accelerate the release of new software features and improve monitoring of systems in production, but its crucial implications for software architects and architecture are often ignored.   In  DevOps: A Software Architect’s Perspective,  three leading architects address these issues head-on. The authors review decisions software architects must make in order to achieve DevOps’ goals and clarify how other DevOps participants are likely to impact the architect’s work. They also provide the organizational, technical, and operational context needed to deploy DevOps more efficiently, and review DevOps’ impact on each development phase. The authors address cross-cutting concerns that link multiple functions, offering practical insights into compliance, performance, reliability, repeatability, and security.   This guide demonstrates the authors’ ideas in action with three real-world case studies: datacenter replication for business continuity, management of a continuous deployment pipeline, and migration to a microservice architecture.   Comprehensive coverage includes • Why DevOps can require major changes in both system architecture and IT roles • How virtualization and the cloud can enable DevOps practices • Integrating operations and its service lifecycle into DevOps • Designing new systems to work well with DevOps practices • Integrating DevOps with agile methods and TDD • Handling failure detection, upgrade planning, and other key issues • Managing consistency issues arising from DevOps’ independent deployment models • Integrating security controls, roles, and audits into DevOps • Preparing a business plan for DevOps adoption, rollout, and measurement},

	abstract = {Pesquisadores e analistas, ao compararem a saúde pública brasileira a sistemas similares, sempre salientaram seu subfinanciamento e seu consequente baixo nível per capita. Na maioria das vezes, as análises não foram muito além de denunciar que, em vários momentos, houve perda de recursos. É na tentativa de buscar as razões que condicionaram o subfinanciamento estrutural do Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) que se coloca este artigo. Primeiramente, são resgatados os principais momentos de sua trajetória do ponto de vista do financiamento e salientado que a visão dos constituintes com relação à definição do orçamento da seguridade social estava fadada a fracassar, dado que suas políticas estão fundadas em princípios diferentes, tornando inevitável a disputa de recursos em seu interior na primeira dificuldade. Em seguida, são apresentadas três razões que podem explicar o subfinanciamento do SUS, na esfera ideológica, política e econômica. Conclui-se que a superação do subfinanciamento requer, antes de tudo, mudanças no plano da aceitação do SUS junto à sociedade.},

	abstract = {This latest textbook from bestselling author, Douglas E. Comer, is a class-tested book providing a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing. Focusing on concepts and principles, rather than commercial offerings by cloud providers and vendors, The Cloud Computing Book: The Future of Computing Explained gives readers a complete picture of the advantages and growth of cloud computing, cloud infrastructure, virtualization, automation and orchestration, and cloud-native software design.  The book explains real and virtual data center facilities, including computation (e.g., servers, hypervisors, Virtual Machines, and containers), networks (e.g., leaf-spine architecture, VLANs, and VxLAN), and storage mechanisms (e.g., SAN, NAS, and object storage). Chapters on automation and orchestration cover the conceptual organization of systems that automate software deployment and scaling. Chapters on cloud-native software cover parallelism, microservices, MapReduce, controller-based designs, and serverless computing. Although it focuses on concepts and principles, the book uses popular technologies in examples, including Docker containers and Kubernetes. Final chapters explain security in a cloud environment and the use of models to help control the complexity involved in designing software for the cloud. The text is suitable for a one-semester course for software engineers who want to understand cloud, and for IT managers moving an organization’s computing to the cloud.},

First, monorepos are single repositories that contain multiple projects, related or unrelated, sharing the same dependencies. Second, centralization and standardization are some key characteristics. Third, the main benefits include simplified dependencies, coordination of cross-project changes, and easy refactoring. Fourth, code health, codebase complexity, and tooling investments for both development and execution are considered the main challenges.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Container orchestration frameworks provide support for management of complex distributed applications. Different frameworks have emerged only recently, and they have been in constant evolution as new features are being introduced. This reality makes it difficult for practitioners and researchers to maintain a clear view of the technology space. (2) Methods: we present a descriptive feature comparison study of the three most prominent orchestration frameworks: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos, which can be combined with Marathon, Aurora or DC/OS. This study aims at (i) identifying the common and unique features of all frameworks, (ii) comparing these frameworks qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to genericity in terms of supported features, and (iii) investigating the maturity and stability of the frameworks as well as the pioneering nature of each framework by studying the historical evolution of the frameworks on GitHub. (3) Results: (i) we have identified 124 common features and 54 unique features that we divided into a taxonomy of 9 functional aspects and 27 functional sub-aspects. (ii) Kubernetes supports the highest number of accumulated common and unique features for all 9 functional aspects; however, no evidence has been found for significant differences in genericity with Docker Swarm and DC/OS. (iii) Very little feature deprecations have been found and 15 out of 27 sub-aspects have been identified as mature and stable. These are pioneered in descending order by Kubernetes, Mesos, and Marathon. (4) Conclusion: there is a broad and mature foundation that underpins all container orchestration frameworks. Likely areas for further evolution and innovation include system support for improve \emph{cluster} ecurity and container security, performance isolation of GPU, disk and network resources, and network plugin architectures.},

ARM originally stood for ‘Acorn RISC Machines’ but over the years changed to ‘Advanced RISC Machines’. It was started as just an experiment but showed promising results and now it is omnipresent in our modern devices. Unlike x86 which is designed for high performance, ARM focuses on low power consumption with considerable performance. Because of the advancements in the ARM technology, they are becoming more powerful than their x86 counterparts. In this analysis we will collate the two architectures briefly and conclude which microprocessor will dominate the microprocessor industry. The processor which will perform better in different tests will be more suitable for the reader to use in their application. The shift in the industry towards ARM processors can change how we write softwares which in turn will affect the whole software development environment.},

	abstract = {Virtualization is a technology that allows the physical machine resources to be shared among different virtual machines 
(VMs). It is provided by a software layer called hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). The hypervisor abstracts
the hardware from the operating system permitting multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on the same
hardware. Many different hypervisors--both open source and commercial-- exist today and are widely used in parallel and
distributed computing. While the goals of these hypervisors are the same, the underlying technologies vary. Our target
hypervisors in this paper are: Microsoft (MS) Hyper-V Server, VMware vSphere ESXi and Xen. MS Hyper-V Server and
Xen are micro-kernelized hypervisors which leverage para-virtualization together with full-virtualization/hardware-assisted
virtualization approaches, while ESXi is a monolithic hypervisor supporting only full-virtualization/hardware-assisted
approach.
A series of performance experiments are conducted on each virtualization approach of the latest versions (at the time of
this study which started in May 2013) for the mentioned hypervisors using Linux PREEMPT-RT as the guest operating
system. This paper discusses and compares the results of these experiments.},

Discrete Markov theory is applied to propose a dynamic Pod fault-tolerant EMS model. The results of the solution model are used to adjust the Pod redundancy in real-time to achieve the highest reliability to satisfy physical resource constraints. The results of the performance analysis show that the reliability of the proposed architecture is 99.9999504\%. Compared with the EMS of the service-oriented architecture (SOA), the annual failure time is reduced from 3.83 minutes to 0.26 minutes. The comprehensive utilization of hardware resources increases by approximately 20\%, and performance indicators such as the peak access success rate improve significantly. The proposed architecture is implemented in a real-power system, with good operating results and broad application prospects.},

	abstract = {Lightweight virtualization, and specifically containers, has become widespread in the information technology industry to provide an efficient operational environment for the execution of scalable services on the Internet. Containers rely on a set of technologies different from the features that enable hardware virtualization (i.e., hypervisor-based virtual machines). However, both types of virtualized environments are employed to host applications that will be accessible anytime, anywhere. Thus, they are prone to software aging, which usually affects systems that run for long time intervals. Researchers have identified software aging effects in distinct types of cloud computing environments and hypervisors over recent years. However, a few works have dealt with this phenomenon in container-based platforms. This paper presents an experimental analysis of the software aging effects observed on Docker platforms while also evaluating a time- series model's fitness to predict resource consumption's progress caused by software aging. We employ a stress test workload tailored for the scenario of containers arranged in  \emph{cluster} anaged by Docker Swarm. The obtained results indicate an increasing usage of resident memory, virtual memory, and CPU usage, as the system undergoes subsequent scale-up and scale-down operations. The quadratic trend model was the best fitting approach for predicting resident and virtual memory usage, with less than 5\% of prediction error. The experimental approach presented here may help systems administrators detect evidence of software aging in container- based environments, allowing them to choose a proper method and time for deploying rejuvenation actions to mitigate the dependability issues raised in similar scenarios described here.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the Brazilian healthcare environment has forced a change in the way organizations are managed. This is due to the rise in healthcare cost, with the appearance of new diagnostic techniques, and to the decentralization of public health initiatives. Therefore,the increase in decision-making efficiency and efficacy has become necessary for the survival of healthcare organizations. In this context, decision support systems are regarded as particularly suitable tools to promote improvements in the healthcare system. This dissertation intended to study the informational flow of NUPAD, as a healthcare organization. NUPAD, an UFMG department, is responsible for the coordination of neonatal screening in Minas Gerais State. The case study was directed by three questions: Which is the influence of information, organization and cognition on decision-making; Which is the best description for thedecision-making process that occur in the organization; How can we create an information systems for decision support in healthcare organizations. Organizational structure has important mechanisms of influence, through corporate governance rules and through sharing of cultural identity. The collaborative nature of decisions and the relevance of managers cognitive aspects in dealing with sensitive healththemes were also demonstrated. Finally, the study suggests that many descriptions of the decision-making processes are suitable to explain organizational decision, showing the complexity of managers job. Decision support systems should cover the collaborative aspectof decisions. Professionals that can bridge the needs of users, developers and the reality of healthcare organizations can decrease the probability of failures in the creation of such systems. The study ends with suggestions for new studies.},
