\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
    A large analysis of masses of data sometimes requires one or more high-performance computers to make information gathering feasible. In the area of research, heads of public institutions, there is a restriction or restriction that, in recent years, has shown an increase in the amount made available. In this way, like health, study, study areas, have the problems and problems of creating computers that enable study. An alternative to the need for high-performance computers is the use of distributed computing techniques. The first stage of the work is to carry out a study of the tools available on the market and propose an objective and comparison solution to, in the later stage, compare the performance of resource orchestration in a low-cost \emph{cluster} in full virtualization and virtualization based in adjustments for processing data analysis in, such as azithromycin trend in years 2014 and 202. Contribution resulting from this research.
